# 🎧 JustInCase — Subtitle Generator



**JustInCase** is a tool that generates `.srt` subtitles from any given audio file — *just in case* you need them. Built using OpenAI's Whisper model, it's a way to caption voiceovers, dialogues, lectures, or any spoken content.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Transcribes audio to text using Whisper (`small` model).
- Formats time into standard `.srt` style (HH:MM:SS,mmm).
- Outputs an editable `.srt` file alongside your audio.
- Friendly CLI interface with colored prompts for clarity.

## Things To Pay Attention
- Subtitle accuracy depends on audio quality, speaker clarity, background noise, and language.
- May mishear fast, slurred, or gibberish speech.
- Recommended for English and clean voiceovers.
- You can edit the .srt manually if needed (And sometimes you may need to correct them)


# Note
Actually man... JustInCase can be called as one of the child programs of one of my biggest projects PHOENIX. So Obviously, Phoenix is my personal stuff, but I got the idea of subtitle generator, created, polished and launched it as a separate project, and this separate project is also used in Phoenix!

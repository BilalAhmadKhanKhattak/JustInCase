## Things To Pay Attention

- Subtitle accuracy depends on audio quality, speaker clarity, background noise, and language.
- Processing time depends on the Audio Length, and Computer Performance (but not only)
- May mishear fast, slurred, or gibberish speech.
- Recommended for English and clean voiceovers.
- You can edit the .srt manually (separately, not in JustInCase) if needed (And sometimes you may need to correct them) 

## Words By Mr. BILRED
Yeah, this was a part of PHOENIX. But I never knew I would get "this" much deeper in it. Actually (the thing about part of PHOENIX) the thing is, I tried to use Whisper in Phoenix for transcription purposes, then probably then I got the idea why not make a subtitle generator tool. Furthermore; I built this in my vacations, and this also took alot of time. What I also want you to understand is that is, uhm, there's a difference between "Making things work" and "Why things work". When you get to understand both, ah! then its something really ____. Nevertheless, I almost tried 12 times on macOS and 4 times on Windows OS, I was trying to do something, but that didnt happen. Eitherway, there might be some ALLAH's (God) wisdom. 
And yeah, You should take an idea from this project that... I even got to know one of the PYTHON 3.10's OWN BUGS! That's something really special happened
